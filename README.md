# snap2text

This is an simple extension to help you convert images to text using screenshot or image file.

**Reason for Development**
Sometimes when I watch a video, they go to a link in the video, usually in training videos, but there is never a link below the video, so I have to transcribe the screenshot to get to the link.

Normally I could use a google plugin for this, but I interact with multiple computers and each computer can be random, so instead of bothering to install a plugin on each one, I carry my self-written plugins on a flash drive.


**If you use linux, you can install it with:**
```bash
$ sudo apt install gnome-screenshot
$ sudo apt-get install xclip
```

**also**
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


**computers that I interact with:**
- School computers (when I help my friends with their projects)
- Internet cafe (when I play games with my friends or when I need to get some work done)
- My brother's or a friend's computer (when they ask me for something or I have to show them something)
- My own computer
- My teacher's computer (when I need to show my projects)
